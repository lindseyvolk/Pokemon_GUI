Overview: In this game, we are creating a multiplayer Pokemon game in which the user is able to collect Pokemon and battle their friends. This is to be made as an Android application, and will be demonstrated for the EC327 Introduction to Programming Course.


How To Build: We utilized Android Studio to build our project. We have provided the entire app in the src folder on Github. This includes the java and xml files for the backend and frontend as well as the png files for the Pokemon image display. To build our game, you must have Android Studio downloaded and must create a new project called PokemonSelection2. You must copy and paste our app folder into the app folder that is created by Android Studio on project initialization and must sync the gradle files. Then, you must use the Pixel XL emulator to run our game. We have also provided the individual java, xml, and png files in the misc folder on Github for review.
